### Individual Data Analysis (Results Not Shown in the Article)
This section comprises scripts to analyze single-nuclei multiomics data obtained from Day0, Day1, and Day3. The analysis served the purpose of excluding low-quality cells and was complemented with clustering analysis to identify key populations.

### Merge All Datasets (Figure 4B. 4C, 4D)
The All_Days_ARC.py script contains the complete set of codes required to merge all the individual datasets and obtain the final clustering results.

### Advanced Analysis (Figure 1E, 1F, S1)
This section also includes the code for performing advanced analyses, which encompass scVelo, StemFinder, Tricycle, and GRN. These analyses contribute to a comprehensive exploration of the data.
