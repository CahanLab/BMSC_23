# BMSC Multipotency Code book
The following sections contain scripts and data to demonstrate how the results in the manuscript were generated.

### Meta-analysis section
This section includes scripts and data utilized to generate the results of a meta-analysis involving 20 independent samples collected from six distinct single-cell RNA sequencing studies.

### BMSC Differentiation section
We collected BMSCs at four different time points - day 0, day 1, day 3, and day 7 - during the induction of three gold-standard lineages. The folder contains both the scripts and data necessary to reproduce the results.

### BMSC Multipotency section
To bridge the discrepancy observed between the heterogenous freshly isolated BMSCs and homogenous multipotent BMSC, we collected BMSCs isolated at day 0, day 1, and day 3 to elucidate the derivation of multipotent BMSCs and identify critical regulators govern the multipotency in BMSCs.
