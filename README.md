# BMSC Single-cell/ Single-nuclei Resource
The following sections contain scripts and data to demonstrate how the results in the manuscript were generated.

## Raw Data
All the raw data is deposited to the GEO database under accession number [GSE234540](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE234540)

## Scripts and Processed Data
### Meta-analysis section
This section includes scripts and data utilized to generate the results of a meta-analysis involving 20 independent samples collected from six distinct single-cell RNA sequencing studies.

### BMSC Differentiation section
We collected BMSCs at four different time points - day 0, day 1, day 3, and day 7 - during the induction of three gold-standard lineages. The folder contains both the scripts and data necessary to reproduce the results.

### BMSC Multipotency section
To bridge the discrepancy observed between the heterogenous freshly isolated BMSCs and homogenous multipotent BMSC, we collected BMSCs isolated at day 0, day 1, and day 3 to elucidate the derivation of multipotent BMSCs and identify critical regulators govern the multipotency in BMSCs.

## Python and R Environment
