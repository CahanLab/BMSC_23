# BMSC Resource
The following sections contain scripts and data to reproduce results in the article "HIPPO PROMOTES SELF-RENEWAL OF MURINE BONE MARROW SKELETAL STEM CELLS BY TEAD AND AP1 ACTIVATION".

## Raw Data
All the raw data is deposited to the GEO database under accession number [GSE234540](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE234540)

## Scripts and Processed Data
### Meta-analysis section
This section comprises scripts and data employed in conducting a meta-analysis involving 20 independent samples collected from six distinct single-cell RNA sequencing studies.

### BMSC Differentiation section
We collected Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSCs) at four different time points - day 0, day 1, day 3, and day 7 - during the induction of three gold-standard lineages. The folder contains both the scripts and data necessary to reproduce the results.

### BMSC Multipotency section
To address the observed discrepancy between heterogenous freshly isolated BMSCs and homogenous multipotent BMSCs, we collected BMSCs post-isolation at day 0, day 1, and day 3 to elucidate the derivation of multipotent BMSCs and identify critical regulators governing multipotency in BMSCs.

## Python and R Environment
The environment.txt file lists detailed information about the package versions used in the analysis.
