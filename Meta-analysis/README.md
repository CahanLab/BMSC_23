# Metaanalysis Section
Here we provided the entire pipeline to show how we obtain the results in Metaanalysis section (Figure 1)

## Individual data analysis (Results not shown in the article)
All the individual dataset were analyzed separately to exclude low quality cells and completed with clustering to identify key populations in bone marrow stroma.

## Merge all dataset (Figure 1A, 1C)
The Merge_all.py provides complete codes to get the final clustering results.

### Advanced analysis
The code to other advanced analysis, including scVelo, StemFinder, Tricycle, and GSEApy were also included in the section.
