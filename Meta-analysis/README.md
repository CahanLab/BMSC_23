# Meta-analysis Section
In this section, we present the entire pipeline that illustrates the process of obtaining the results outlined in the Metaanalysis section. (Figure 1)

## Individual Data Analysis (Results Not Shown in the Article)
In this step, each individual dataset was analyzed separately. This analysis served the purpose of excluding low-quality cells and was complemented with clustering analysis to identify key populations within the bone marrow stroma.

## Merge All Datasets (Figure 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D)
The Merge_all.py script contains the complete set of codes required to merge all the individual datasets and obtain the final clustering results.

### Advanced Analysis (Figure 1E, 1F, S1)
This section also includes the code for performing advanced analyses, which encompass scVelo, StemFinder, Tricycle, and GSEApy. These analyses contribute to a comprehensive exploration of the data.
